## Studying only

The idea was to build a dummy page in which is made a simple request to a Node.js server.

This dummy page should be published using a docker image with Nginx.

Another test will be to implement Kubernetes.   

### How to run the project

Reach the root folder on your terminal and type:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
